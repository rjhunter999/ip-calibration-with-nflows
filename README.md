# ip-calibration-with-nflows
Small project to investigate if the mismodelling in the LHCb simulation of the muon impact parameter resolution of Z decays can be corrected/described using normalising flows.

`notebooks/tutorial.ipynb` essentially implements the `nflows` [tutorial](https://pypi.org/project/nflows/) - I also looked in the `moons` tutorial for some help.
This was all neatened up into a script under `scripts/tutorial.py`.
